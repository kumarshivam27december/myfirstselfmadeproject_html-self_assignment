<p>Proper education improves people's understanding of the world around them,
     making them less susceptible to the influence of others.
      Proper interpretation of information requires education,
       as it improves knowledge. An educated person better understands their own and others'
        purpose in society, and their rights. This leads to a better understanding of people,
         fewer conflicts and more tolerance for differences. 

    Educated persons are harder to manipulate,
     which is conducive to the development of a more responsible society with fewer conflicts.
      All this creates an environment where social justice can thrive, which entails:
    
    Equal rights
    Equal opportunity
    Equal treatment

    Education in society helps people to be more active in their struggle for a better quality of life.
     As the citizens' understanding of the world around them grows,
      the entire society strives towards more efficient solutions to problems and
       the advancement of everyday life. This is an important mission for the whole of humankind,
        and it is crucial that each individual should have opportunities for personal advancement
         and making their own contribution.    </p>
